# odin-recipes

This is my first (The Odin) project on HTML. It is an HTML-only website with recipes for the user to pick from and assess their cooking skills with.

New recipes may be added by creating additional HTML files and linking them properly on index.html

Hope you have fun poking around my newbie coder stuff. :)
